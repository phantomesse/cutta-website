			"jakob": "Jakob is the boss of CUTTA. He is our boss, but he\u2019s his own boss too, and always prioritizes CUTTA before any other aspect of his busy student life. His new strategies are changing the world, and this year he is all about sprinkling ESL tutoring opportunities everywhere around campus. Besides being crazy about CUTTA, Jakob is the greatest fan Japan will ever have. If you want to become friends with Jakob, talk to him about Japan and he will take you out to great Japanese restaurants and teach you some amazing Japanese.",
			"lauren": "Lauren is the king of coding. She does it with such minimal effort you won\u2019t believe your eyes. Her pink Macbook Air can indeed handle a lot of things, and this new CUTTA website was created solely on that amazing thin gadget. Having a knack for tech-y things, she will teach you everything from how to build a bridge that can handle two elephants, to how not to spill caf\u00e9 mocha on a shaky table. This Columbia marvel also holds her own office hours, since she is a Teaching Assistant. If you\u2019re thinking of dropping by her office with some pie, make sure it has real blueberries in it because she hates the fake gooey ones. ",
			"reina": "Artist, designer, language instructor, translator. Our own shining star and talented cosmopolitan citizen from Tokyo, Reina Imagawa, is a junior in Columbia College majoring in Urban Studies. Reina joined our team as a Japanese translator in the fall of 2011. She has then grown to be an integrated part of CUTTA and has taken on a very important role in client communications. Besides being a crucial piece of our squad within CUTTA, Reina pushes the boundaries of fashion to a higher level through designing and making her own clothes. Reina has also been part of the team who developed the new CUTTA website. Given that Reina is a face of the agency for external relations, don't be surprised if she picks up the phone next time you call."
